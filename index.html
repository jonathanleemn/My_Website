                        <p>There are 241 stone steps to reach the top of the hermitage. At the top of the crag, there's a large bell that 
                            supposedly grants wishes if you ring it three times and no more.

                        <p>I'm gonna be honest; I had idea what purpose this "tomb-like" section served. I wasn't able 
                            to find any plaques around and there wasn't anyone else around. It it hadn't been for the area being well-lit I would've
                            questioned if guests were even allowed in this area. Despite not knowing the history behind it, 
                            it was still a really cool spot to explore within the palace.
